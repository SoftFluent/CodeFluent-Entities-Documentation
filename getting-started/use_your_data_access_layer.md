Add a loop to display the list of your products.

```csharp
using System;
using OrderProcess.Marketing;

namespace OrderProcess.Application
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            foreach (Product product in ProductCollection.LoadAll())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```


## Add instances

Your application source code should be ready for display, now let's add some data into our model. Select the Product entity and open the Instances Grid windows from the ribbon.
