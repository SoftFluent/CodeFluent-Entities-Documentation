# Microsoft SQL Server code generator

The **Microsoft SQL Server Producer** is a persistence producer which will translate your CodeFluent Entities model into a Microsoft SQL Server database.

Designing your model, you can define business concepts (e.g. entities, properties, methods, views), relations from a concept to another as well as the logic in which they all interact with one another. From this platform independent model, a meta-model is built which will be translated by producers to generate platform specific code.

From this meta-model, the Microsoft SQL Server Producer generates a set of **T-SQL scripts** which create data objects; translating platform independent concepts (e.g. a Customer entity) into platform specific code (e.g. a Customer table). On the same principles:

* Properties become columns,
* Methods become stored procedures,
* Instances become lines of data,
* Entity keys become primary keys,
* Entity relation properties become foreign keys,
* Views in your model become actual SQL views,
* etc.

All those data objects are created by the generated scripts. By default, those generated scripts are ran automatically when building your model.

Furthermore, the Microsoft SQL Server Producer has a **differential engine**, meaning that between generations the database isn't dropped and created over but **altered** (columns and procedures added, types changed). This feature is a key feature, since it allows to generate continuously, driving developments from the model.
