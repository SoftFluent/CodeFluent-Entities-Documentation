# Microsoft SQL Server code generator

The **Microsoft SQL Server Producer** is a persistence producer which will translate your CodeFluent Entities model into a Microsoft SQL Server database.

Designing your model, you can define business concepts (e.g. entities, properties, methods, views), relations from a concept to another as well as the logic in which they all interact with one another. From this platform independent model, a meta-model is built which will be translated by producers to generate platform specific code.
