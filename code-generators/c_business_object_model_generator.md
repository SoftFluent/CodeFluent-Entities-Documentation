# C# Business Object Model generator

## Overview 

The **Business Object Model** producer can generate the business objects layer above the persistence layer. It generates .NET class for the entities declared in design model.

For each entity, the BOM producer generates two business objects : one object for the entity and one object for the entity set.

You can notice that the producer has generated two class for the Customer entity :

* the Customer class with the properties Id, FirstName, LastName
* the CustomerCollection class with the properties Count and this[int index].

You can also notice that the two class have the same signature for the Insert, Save and Delete method. Fortunately, for the Load method, the signature is different : the Customer class has a Load method to load one entity and the CustomerCollection class has a LoadAll method to load all the entities.
