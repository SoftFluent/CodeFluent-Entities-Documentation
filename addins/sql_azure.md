# SQL Azure

The SQL Azure producer translates your model into SQL Azure compliant T-SQL scripts to generate the equivalent SQL Azure database. Moreover the generated scripts can be run automatically on the SQL Azure database.

*Note: Unlike the SQL Server Producer, this producer doesn't create the SQL Azure database. On SQL Azure, billing is based, in part, on your database edition and size. Therefore, we're letting developers create their database as desired, and the tool focuses on generating the database schema (schemas, tables, views, stored procedures, constraints, data, etc.).*

Another key feature of the SQL Azure producer, is that you can work locally, by generating on a local SQL Server database. In this scenario, the SQL Azure producer will generate 100% compliant code on both platforms. Furthermore, when generating on a SQL Server instance, the producer detects it and will use a **diff engine** which will update the database through generations rather than dropping and creating it over.

This diff engine is in fact a key feature since it allows developers to generate continuously, without ever losing data. Once the application is ready to go live, the developer can configure the producer to run the scripts on the online SQL Azure database.

*Using CodeFluent Entities versions **prior to** 60809.671, the Diff Engine uses SQL Distributed Management Objects (SQL-DMO), therefore, if using SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2 as your local server, you'll need to install this component on your server to benefit from this feature.*
