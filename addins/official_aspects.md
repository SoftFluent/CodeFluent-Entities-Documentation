For more information, see the [Aspect oriented modeling overview]().

## Localization Aspect

The localization aspect enables data localization (a.k.a. dynamic localization) support.

*Note: This aspect only supports C# as the BOM layer. As the persistence layer, **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Oracle Database** are supported.*

Pick the **SoftFluent.Localization.xml** file into the CodeFluent Entities installation directory.
