Leverage the centralized platform-independent model describing your business application thanks to the Visual Studio integrated Modeler.

**Model-First**: Transform your business into a model using a natural and visual modeling approach. You don't need to learn anything to start.

**Visual Studio Integration**: The graphical modeler is fully integrated in Microsoft Visual Studio (from 2008 to 2015).

**Application-wide**: Apply application-wide changes in a few clicks such as cache and naming conventions.

**Absorb functional changes**: Improve your agility by accepting model changes at any time.

**Import your database**: Create your model in minutes by importing your existing database schema and data.

Define your foundations
-------------
From your business model, CodeFluent Entities generates Transact-SQL scripts and C# code. Focus on what makes the difference.

**Human-readable**: No code generated at runtime, everything is human-readable and can be changed if needed.

**Reduce dependencies**: Minimize heavy plumbing work and internal framework development.

**Continuously generate**: Update your model and ensure consistency across all layers.

**Minimize risk**: Less manual code means fewer bugs and effortless maintenance.

**Extensibility**: Generated code is composed of partial classes. Extending it is nothing more than standard .NET development.

**Incremental updates**: The Microsoft SQL Server differential engine enables hassle-free schema updates without losing any data.

Develop your application
-------------
Create your application by using the generated data access layer composed of .NET classes.

**Simple and reliable**: CRUD operations and validation are supported out-of-the-box and without a single line of code.

**Paginate your data**: All the loading methods support server-side paging.

**Data Access Layer**: Simplified access to data stored in your SQL Server storage.

**Database sorting**: Sorting is done in the persistence layer to ensure optimal performances.

```csharp
Customer customer = Customer.LoadbyName("Contoso");
customer.IsProspect = false;
customer.Save();
```
