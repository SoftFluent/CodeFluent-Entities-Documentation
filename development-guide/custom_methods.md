# Custom methods

## Load

Load methods allow you to define a platform independent query, loading sets of data.

This query will then be translated into a platform specific code by a producer. For instance, the [Microsoft SQL Server Producer](../code-generators/microsoft_sql_server_code_generator.md) will translate it into a T-SQL query.
