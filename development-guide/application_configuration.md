# Application configuration

The **Business Object Model** (BOM) is the only layer which has a direct access to the data layer; hence you have to configure its connection settings to it. To do so, CodeFluent provides in the **CodeFluent.Runtime.dll** a configuration section handler. Consequently, all you have to do to configure your application's connection settings, is to create a configuration section of the BOM's namespace, and in this section, specify the connection string.
